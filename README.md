# Tonigy - Multimedia CD System/2

This is the source code of Tonigy written by me for OS/2 in 2001-2002.

The idea behind the IFS separation is taken from here: [OS/2 Installable File Systems - Part 1/3](http://www.edm2.com/0103/os2ifs1.html), [OS/2 Installable File Systems - Part 2/3](http://www.edm2.com/0105/os2ifs2.html), [OS/2 Installable File Systems - Part 3/3](http://www.edm2.com/0107/os2ifs3.html)
