Main Screen
===========

If "Auto attach" options is on,  this drive  will be  automatic attached  when
Tonigy is started.  Warning: All drives will be automatic detached when Tonigy
is closed.

You can use following keys to control Tonigy main screen:

 Alt+A  Attach drive
 Alt+D  Detach drive
 Alt+S  Setup drive
 Alt+X  Exit 

Setup Dialog
============

When "Anti-Jitter"  options  is  on,  Tonigy  tries to correct CD-ROM  drive's 
troubles with synchronization of reading.  It slows reading speed,  but it  is
necessary for some CD-ROM drive models. To  determination of presence  of such
troubles with  synchronization of  reading, work  with any  RAW or WAV file on
Tonigy drive (copy it, play it or view it by hex-editor, state of "Anti-Jitter"
options is unimportant). Then see a text after "x audio track(s)." line in the
CDINFO.TXT on Tonigy drive. If this text is "This CD-ROM Drive has no troubles
with synchronization of reading.",  you can disable "Antijitter" to increase a
track reading speed.

"Tries to correct" options sets the amount of attempts of  correction troubles
with  synchronization  of  reading.  When  still troubles cannot  be corrected,
Tonigy returns a really readed data. If you have slow CD-ROM  drive and listen
to WAV or RAW files  from  Tonigy drive,  it better  to set  a small  value of
correction tries. But when WAV or RAW files  from Tonigy drive  are encoded or
copied, it better to set a bigger value.

Extended Attributes
===================

Tonigy supports extended  attributes for  all files on Tonigy drive.  Extended
attributes are stored in EA.INI file. Extended attributes of WAV and RAW files
are compact-disk-dependent  (keys  are  a number  of track,  a start sector of
track and a length of track).
