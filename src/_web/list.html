<p align=center><b>Are you going to read and write into the Tonigy mail-list?</b></p>
<p>Yes, this is the way.</p>

<form action="/cgi-bin/list.pl" method="post">
Enter your E-Mail: <input maxlength=40 name=email>
<input type=submit value="Send request">
</form>

<p>The form sends the request message to the &lt;majordomo@defgroup.com&gt; e-mail.
Be ready to receive an answer with the description of an action needed in order 
to confirm your subscription to the mail-list. This is why you should
enter a correct e-mail address. It may seem quite complex, however the reason
is your own security.</p>

<p>The version for internal tests only!</p>
